# FE
Feeleat  focuses on helping people, especially teenagers, aged 14-18, recovering from eating disorders by providing them with a safe environment to write down their feelings about their meals. 
This website can help people face their inner thoughts and discover different standards of beauty, not only about appearance or how they look. As globalization accelerates and different societies become interconnected to one another, the singular standard of beauty develops over time. This means that one tends to not think about their own identity or characteristics anymore, and rather try to follow what others (e.g., celebrities) do in terms of appearance.
