								<h3>Why</h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
								<p>As we are more moving the next gen of technology, the age group that suffers a lot is the teenage group that suffers a lot. Social media use can also negatively affect teens, distracting them, disrupting their sleep, and exposing them to bullying, rumor spreading, unrealistic views of other people's lives and peer pressur </p>
=======
								<p>We find it is a common that people worry about their body shape and causing eating problems. For some teenagers facing eating disorders, they are not willing to talk to others about their thoughts and troubles, 
									concerning about all the judgement. Using our website, they are safe with their inner-self and hopefully, such writing can help them orgnize 
									their thoughts. </p>

								<h3>Who</h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
								<p>The main target audience for this project are high school teenagers.
									Since present society is surrounded by various media and we are often exposed to those media, we are slowly and unconsciously losing the ability to think independently and become busy copying others. These social pressures can cause various problems, one of which can make us overly obsessed with appearance. 
									In fact, many people are struggling with eating disorders while trying to follow strict diets and only chase the beauty standards set by society. We intended to provide a possible solution for a real-life health problem in the given short time

						<h3>"Connecting the gap that social media has created and minimising it".</h3>

					<blockquote>
						<p>The idea started from the experience of only having an apple for breakfast and thinking that would hold me till the end of afternoon lectures, ending up being hungry and could not concentrate on the task. Such a misjudgment of myself of how much food I should eat inspired the idea of keeping a record of what you ate and how that made you feel. Then this reminded one of the team members of the  personal experiences of suffering from eating disorders during teenagehood. Eating disorders usually occur to avoid solving the actual causes of anxiety. Teenage girls can easily be pressured into unhealthy dieting to fit in social-standard beauty and feel guilty and self-disgusted after eating a normal portion of food for people their age. We find this is a common problem that people around us just to different extents. The first step of healing is always to recognize the problem. Thus, keeping a diary about food and your feelings will make eating more like a meaningful process instead of an inner tug of war.  </p>
